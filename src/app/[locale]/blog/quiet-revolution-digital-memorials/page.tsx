        <h2 className="text-3xl font-nunito font-bold mt-12 mb-6">Why the Ritual of Memory Is Changing</h2>
        <p>
          For centuries a headstone could offer only a name, two dates and perhaps a single line of verse. Today a visitor can stand in the same place, raise a phone and watch a 4‑K film of the person who lies beneath, hear their voice, read their letters, or add a new photograph to a living archive.
        </p>
        <p>
          The practice is spreading quickly. Google records roughly 33,000 searches every month for the phrase "online memorial"—a steep rise over the past three years. At the same time, more than 5.7 billion people now carry smartphones capable of reading a QR code in less than a second. When technology becomes that ordinary, even rituals as old as burial begin to evolve.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-3xl font-nunito font-bold mt-12 mb-6">From Stone to Screen: The Mechanics of a Modern Memorial</h2>
        <p>
          The bridge between the physical grave and its digital counterpart is usually a small, weather‑resistant QR plaque. Evere's Forever Medallion is one such device. It is deliberately understated—50 mm by 50 mm, three millimetres thick—so that it does not disturb the design of the stone. Yet its materials and data architecture are built for decades.

          Once the plaque is in place, the process is simple: clean the stone, press or screw the tag, scan with any camera. A secure web page appears, ready to accept the first photograph and basic details. The page defaults to "unlisted," meaning only those who possess the link—or who visit the grave in person—can view it. The owner may switch to "password‑only" for privacy or to "public" if open access is preferred.

        <h2 className="text-3xl font-nunito font-bold mt-12 mb-6">Installation: A Short, Irreversible Moment</h2>
        <p>
          The physical act of affixing the plaque is brief but deliberate. Conservation guides recommend cleaning the stone with isopropyl alcohol to remove lichens and surface dust. The 3 M VHB™ pad bonds to polished granite after thirty seconds of firm pressure and reaches full strength in twenty‑four hours; for unpolished stones, small stainless screws secure the tag permanently. Many families keep the spare plaque in a memory box or attach it to a keepsake urn.

        <p>
          Remember Well now holds a solid 3.8‑star average—an improvement driven by quicker deliveries and more responsive customer service. Its incremental storage fees, however, erase most of the initial price advantage once families approach the five‑gigabyte limit.

        <h2 className="text-3xl font-nunito font-bold mt-12 mb-6">Market Context: Why QR Headstones Have Moved from Novelty to Norm</h2>
        <p>
          Research published in late 2024 projects that the QR‑enabled headstone market will grow from USD 1.5 billion in 2024 to USD 3.8 billion by 2033, a compound annual rate above ten percent. Funeral directors report a noticeable shift: families who once declined technology at the graveside now inquire about it first, especially when arranging services for younger relatives.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ireland offers an instructive example. In County Kerry a family installed what local media called the region's first "interactive headstone." Visitors can stand among nineteenth‑century markers yet, with one scan, hear a modern seafarer's log or play a curated Spotify list. The juxtaposition is striking but seldom considered disrespectful; most who experience it describe the gesture as humane.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-3xl font-nunito font-bold mt-12 mb-6">Beyond the Human Grave: Other Uses</h2>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-3">
          <li><strong>Pet memorials</strong> – A plaque on an urn or in a garden records the sound of a familiar bark or purr.</li>
          <li><strong>Historic landmarks</strong> – Municipalities attach QR tags to monuments; tourists can read archival documents on site.</li>
          <li><strong>Family time‑capsules</strong> – A memorial page can be set to unlock letters or videos to children on specific future dates, maintaining a controlled timeline.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Evere's dashboard supports multiple pages under a single account, allowing one family to manage a pet memorial, a historic homestead and a traditional grave within the same interface.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-3xl font-nunito font-bold mt-12 mb-6">Emerging Horizons: Augmented Reality and Digital Provenance</h2>
        <p>
          The next frontier is presentation rather than storage. Evere's public roadmap references augmented‑reality story walks: hold a phone over the grave and a translucent figure would appear, recounting a life in situ. Analysts in the cemetery‑technology sector describe AR headstones as "the most likely successor to static video tributes in the coming decade."
        </p>
        <p>
          Parallel work is underway on blockchain time‑stamps, ensuring that each photograph or document uploaded today can be verified as original fifty years hence, an important safeguard for historians.

        <h2 className="text-3xl font-nunito font-bold mt-12 mb-6">Questions Consumers Commonly Ask</h2>
        <div className="space-y-4">
          <div>
            <h3 className="font-bold">Will the plaque corrode?</h3>
            <p>Stainless and aluminium develop protective oxide layers; porcelain is impervious to moisture. All three pass accelerated salt‑spray tests.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div>
            <h3 className="font-bold">What if a phone has no signal in the cemetery?</h3>
            <p>The QR code encodes a URL; once scanned, the page loads as soon as the device regains coverage or Wi‑Fi.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div>
            <h3 className="font-bold">Can material be moved if the grave is re‑sited?</h3>
            <p>The plaque is transferable. Evere supplies replacement adhesive pads gratis.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div>
            <h3 className="font-bold">Is data export possible?</h3>
            <p>Yes. A ZIP archive of all media and text can be downloaded at any time.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div>
            <h3 className="font-bold">What happens if Evere ceases trading?</h3>
            <p>A forty‑page escrow agreement with an independent EU data trustee stipulates that all memorials remain accessible for the remainder of the fifty‑year term.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        
        <p className="text-sm mt-4">A complete FAQ appears on the Evere website; adding structured FAQ schema helps the information surface directly in Google results.</p>

        <h2 className="text-3xl font-nunito font-bold mt-12 mb-6">A Closing Word on Permanence and Grace</h2>
        <p>
          Stone was once chosen for its ability to endure. Yet even granite surrenders eventually to wind and lichen. A well‑made digital memorial adds a second layer of permanence—one that is not meant to replace the tactile ritual of visiting a grave but to enrich it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The technology behind a 50 mm headstone QR code is mechanical and mathematical, but its purpose is quietly human: to keep a voice within reach, to allow a child not yet born to meet an ancestor, to ensure that the lessons of a life do not end with the life itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          For families considering the step, the advice offered by grief counsellors is simple: choose a platform that will not burden you with hidden limits, secure your data in a jurisdiction you trust, and place the plaque with care. If those conditions are met, the result is not novelty but continuity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Those who wish to explore further will find a demonstration plaque and full plan details at Evere.io/en. Evaluation can begin with a free page and five photographs; expansion costs nothing more than the decision to remember in full.
