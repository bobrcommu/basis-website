            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
              QR code memorials have become a popular way to honor pets, allowing families to create lasting digital tributes accessible through a simple scan. A durable QR code tag can be placed on a pet's grave marker, memorial stone, or kept as part of a home memorial display.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
              These digital memorials can include unlimited photos, videos of your pet's most endearing moments, their complete life story, and special memories shared by family members. Some pet owners include details about their pet's personality, favorite activities, and the unique ways they enriched their families' lives.

            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
              Creating a memorial garden space provides a living tribute to your pet. This can be as simple as planting your pet's favorite lounging spot with beautiful flowers or as elaborate as designing a dedicated garden area with a memorial stone, pet-safe plants, and decorative elements that reminded you of your companion.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
              Many pet owners choose to incorporate a weather-resistant memorial stone or plaque that includes their pet's name, dates, and a short message or favorite quote. These garden spaces often become peaceful reflection areas where you can feel connected to your pet's memory.

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-nunito font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">Custom Memorial Artwork</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
              Commissioning a portrait or other artwork of your pet creates a lasting visual memory you can display in your home. Options range from traditional painted portraits to modern digital illustrations, sculpted figurines that capture your pet's likeness, or even custom silhouettes.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
              For something more unique, consider paw print art, where your pet's actual paw print becomes part of a framed memorial, or custom jewelry that incorporates your pet's name, silhouette, or even a tiny portion of their ashes for an especially personal keepsake.

            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
              Many pet owners find comfort in creating or purchasing special items that remind them of their pets. Custom stuffed animals made to resemble your pet, memory boxes containing your pet's collar, favorite toys, and photos, or memorial frames with space for a photo and collar tag are all popular options.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
              For those who choose cremation, there are beautiful urns specifically designed for pets, including ones shaped like sleeping animals, decorative boxes with photo displays, or even biodegradable urns that can nurture a memorial tree or plant.

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-nunito font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">Memory Books and Scrapbooks</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
              Creating a dedicated album or scrapbook allows you to gather your favorite photos and memories in one place. Include pictures from throughout your pet's life, write down favorite stories or funny habits, and add mementos like a snippet of fur, a paw print, or their adoption papers.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
              Digital scrapbooks or photo books offer another option, with the advantage of being easy to share with family members who might also cherish these memories. These can be especially meaningful when created as a family activity, allowing everyone to contribute their favorite memories.

            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
              Honoring your pet's memory through charitable giving creates a positive legacy. Consider making a donation to an animal shelter, rescue organization, or veterinary research foundation in your pet's name. Some shelters offer memorial brick programs or memorial walls where your pet's name can be permanently displayed.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
              Volunteering your time at an animal shelter or rescue organization can also be a meaningful way to honor your pet while helping other animals in need. This can be especially healing as it allows you to channel grief into positive action.

            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
              Creating a video montage set to music that held special meaning for you and your pet provides a dynamic way to celebrate their life. Compile favorite photos and video clips showing your pet's personality, special talents, and the joy they brought to your life.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
              These videos become treasured keepsakes that can be revisited on special anniversaries or shared with friends and family who also loved your pet. Many online memorial platforms allow you to host these videos as part of a digital tribute accessible through QR codes.

            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
              If you have older or damaged photos of your beloved pet, professional photo restoration services or AI-powered tools can revitalize these images, ensuring they remain vibrant for years to come. This can be especially meaningful for photos capturing special moments or that perfectly showcase your pet's personality.
